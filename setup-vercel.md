# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide for Vercel Deployment

## Step 1: Deploy to Vercel First

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Click "Import Git Repository"
3. Select `mitchell1972/dogdaycare`
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Wait for the initial deployment to complete

## Step 2: Get Your Vercel Token

1. Go to https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Give it a name like "GitHub Actions"
4. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

## Step 3: Get Project and Org IDs

After your project is deployed on Vercel:

### Option A: From Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your project on Vercel
2. Go to Settings â†’ General
3. You'll find:
   - **Project ID**: Under "Project ID"
   - **Team ID** (Org ID): Under "Project Team" or in the URL

### Option B: Using Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Link to your project (run this in the project directory)
vercel link

# The IDs will be saved in .vercel/project.json
cat .vercel/project.json
```

## Step 4: Add Secrets to GitHub

Go to: https://github.com/mitchell1972/dogdaycare/settings/secrets/actions/new

Add these three secrets:

| Secret Name | Value |
|------------|-------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Your token from Step 2 |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Your Team/Org ID from Step 3 |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Your Project ID from Step 3 |

## Step 5: Test the Deployment

1. Make a small change to any file
2. Commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Test CI/CD deployment"
git push
```
3. Check the Actions tab: https://github.com/mitchell1972/dogdaycare/actions
4. Your site should auto-deploy!

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "Vercel secrets are not configured"
- Double-check all three secrets are added in GitHub
- Secret names must be exact: `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

### If deployment fails
- Check that your Vercel project is linked to the GitHub repo
- Ensure the token hasn't expired
- Try re-running the workflow from the Actions tab

## Your Deployment URLs

- **Production**: https://dogdaycare.vercel.app (or your custom domain)
- **Preview**: Created for each pull request
- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/mitchell1972/dogdaycare/actions
